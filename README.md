# SpringBootExamples

I'm trying to improve the examples on the HaydiKodlayalÄ±m site with my own comments.

Install

- Docker Desktop
- Intellij Idea
- Java ( I used version 8 )

You must run the following commands before running the modules.
Firstly you run the docker and then 
"docker-compose -f ..../main/resources/docker-compose.yml up -d"  (Project have a docker-compose.yml)
